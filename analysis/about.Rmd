This project involves performing functional enrichment using Liyang's ASoC annotation derived from colon organoids (epithelial cells). Using [Million Veteran Program](https://www.research.va.gov/mvp/) data, I will test for functional enrichment of this annotation in other phenotypes using GWAS summary statistics and S-LDSC.
